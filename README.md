<!-- ## Assignment 5
### Alternative 1, Portfolio

- [X] Build a (new-isch) Portfolio site using Next. You can reuse a lot of code from the old one you made in the previous course as well as the design you used in the previous course. Or you can make a new (simpler) one.
- [X] There should, at least, be a portfolio page and an about page with different routes.
- [X] Link to all the sites and GitHub projects you've made in this course so far
  - [X] From Week 01: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 1.
  - [X] From Week 02: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 2.
  - [X] From Week 03: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  - [X] From Week 04: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  - [X] From Week 05, this week: Link to site (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and GitHub repo
- [X] Make sure to provide some kind of image that reflect the work you've done each week.
    - [X] Either a snippet or a scaled down image of a site.
    - [X] For week 1 and 2, the image can be of how it looks in the terminal when you run your program or how the generated HTML page looks like.
- [X] BONUS: Add a custom 404 page
- [ ] Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel.
- [X] Commit and push to a new GitHub repo.
- [ ] In the assignment hand-in, make sure to provide a link to the repo, a screenshot of the site, and a link to the site.

### Addition: Improve upon week 5
- [X] Use eslint, add a custom configuration/style-guide to extend, also add at least one rule change
- [ ] Run all files in the app folder through prettier using npm. Add a custom prettier config with at least one setting changed. You might need a .prettierignore do not run prettier in files other than your own.
- [ ] BONUS: Create an easter egg
    - Add a home-icon/text/button (if there isn't one already).
    - Clicking the home button should take you back to the home page unless you already are on the home page.
    - When you press the home icon/text twice on the home page the home button should wiggle and then fly away (in a speed you can see). Make sure it's two clicks/presses in a row. Not one click then going to another page and coming back and then another click. If you click somewhere else on the home page then it's fine if the next click will trigger the wiggle and disappear.
    - The home button should now be gone on all pages until a refresh of the page. -->
